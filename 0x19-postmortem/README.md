# Issue Summary
**Duration:** August 8, 2023, 10:00 AM to August 8, 2023, 12:30 PM (UTC+0)  
**Impact:** During the stated time frame, users experienced intermittent access issues while interacting with our web application's API services. Approximately 15% of users were affected by slow response times and occasional errors.  
**Root Cause:** The root cause of the issue was an improper configuration of Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) settings on the backend API servers. This misconfiguration resulted in browser security mechanisms blocking cross-origin requests, leading to user-facing errors.

## Timeline
- **10:00 AM:** A surge in error rates was flagged by monitoring tools.
- **10:15 AM:** The issue was identified when engineers noticed elevated API error rates. Users also reported issues accessing certain features.
- **10:30 AM:** Initial investigation focused on server load and performance metrics, suspecting potential server-side causes.
- **10:45 AM:** Load balancer metrics and server performance were ruled out as potential culprits. Focus shifted to network connectivity problems.
- **11:15 AM:** Browser console errors indicated CORS policy violations. Investigation narrowed down to CORS configuration.
- **11:30 AM:** The backend engineering team was brought in to address CORS complexities.
- **11:45 AM:** After reviewing backend server configurations, misconfigured CORS settings were identified as the issue.
- **12:00 PM:** The CORS settings were promptly adjusted to include the correct headers and allowed origins.
- **12:30 PM:** The API responses were verified through browser tools, confirming the fix and resolving the issue.

## Root Cause and Resolution
The issue arose due to incorrect CORS configuration on the backend API servers. The servers were lacking the necessary headers to permit cross-origin requests from the frontend application. This caused browsers to block requests, generating user-facing errors. The problem was rectified by updating the CORS settings to ensure the proper headers and origins were included in the server responses.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures
- **CORS Configuration Review:** Regularly review and validate CORS configurations for accuracy and alignment with frontend application requirements.
- **Automated Testing:** Integrate automated tests into the CI/CD pipeline to simulate cross-origin requests and identify misconfigurations early.
- **Real-time Monitoring:** Set up real-time monitoring with alerts for CORS-related issues to enable swift responses to future incidents.
- **Documentation Update:** Maintain current documentation on CORS best practices and configurations for team reference.
- **Educational Efforts:** Conduct training sessions to enhance developer awareness of CORS policies and security mechanisms.

## Tasks to Address the Issue
- Update CORS Configuration: Apply the corrected CORS settings across all API services.
- Integrate Automated Testing: Incorporate automated CORS testing within the CI/CD workflow.
- Implement Real-time Monitoring: Set up alerts for CORS-related errors in the monitoring system.
- Document Incident and Resolution: Document the incident details, root cause, and resolution in the team's knowledge base.
- Conduct Training Workshop: Organize a workshop on CORS best practices and security considerations for development teams.

In conclusion, the CORS issue stemmed from improperly configured backend API servers. Rapid identification, collaboration among teams, and implementation of corrective measures facilitated a swift resolution. The outlined preventative steps are crucial to averting similar issues in the future, enhancing the reliability of our web application and overall user experience.
